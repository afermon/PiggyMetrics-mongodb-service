# Piggy Metrics (Kubernetes) - Mongo DB image

Each microservice has it's own database, so there is no way to bypass API and access persistance data directly. In this project, MongoDB is used as a primary database for each service. It might also make sense to have a polyglot persistence architecture (—Åhoose the type of db that is best suited to service requirements).
